### Note on Versioning

A GdUnit4 **version** should be specified as a string, such as `v4.2.1`. To run on the latest release, use `latest`, and for the latest unreleased version, use `master`. To keep the version installed in your project, use `installed`.

---

## Usage

```yaml

- uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
  with:
    # The version of Godot in which the tests should be run. (e.g., "4.2.1")
    godot-version: ''

    # The Godot status (e.g., "stable", "rc1", "dev1")
    # Default: stable
    godot-status: ''

    # Set to true to run on Godot .Net version to run C# tests
    # Default: false
    godot-net: ''

    # The project directory in which the action is to be executed.
    # The specified directory must end with a path separator. e.g. ./MyProject/
    # Default: './'
    project_dir: ''

    # The version of GdUnit4 to use. (e.g. "v4.2.0", "latest", "master").
    # Default: latest
    version: ''

    # Comma-separated or newline-separated list of directories containing test to execute..
    paths: ''

    # The test execution timeout in minutes.
    # Default: 10
    timeout: ''

    # The number of retries if the tests fail. (This can be used for flaky test)
    # Default: 0
    retries: ''

    # Additional arguments to pass to GdUnit4 (see https://mikeschulze.github.io/gdUnit4/advanced_testing/cmd/).
    arguments: ''

    # The name of the test report file.
    report-name: ''
```

## Examples

This example runs all tests located under `res://myproject/tests` on Godot-4.2.1-stable with the latest GdUnit4 release.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
  with:
    godot-version: '4.2.1'
    paths: 'res://myproject/tests'
    report-name: 'test-result.xml'
```

In this example, all tests located in 'myproject1/tests' and 'myproject2/tests' are executed using the master branch version of GdUnit4

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
  with:
    godot-version: '4.2.1'
    version: 'master'
    paths: |
      res://myproject1/tests
      res://myproject2/tests
    report-name: 'test-result.xml'
```

In this example, we run the tests but without a published test report.

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
  with:
    godot-version: '4.2.1'
    paths: 'res://tests'
    upload-report: false
```

In this example, we have a custom project structure and needs to setup the `project_dir`

```bash
- root/
  - MyProject/
  - MyProject/src
  - MyProject/tests
```

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: MikeSchulze/gdUnit4-action@v1
  with:
    godot-version: '4.2.1'
    project_dir: './MyProject/'
    paths: 'res://tests'
    
```
